Get bored using only 3 Linux Distributions on Codespaces? Want development environment with always up-to-date tools? You can try this Docker image and see the magic.
### List of Images

2. Fedora (full release only)
3. AlmaLinux (8.5 only)
4. Gentoo (useless but might be wanted for Linux Enthuasist)(soon)
